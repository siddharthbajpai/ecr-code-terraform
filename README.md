# ecr-code-terraform
This terraform code is basically making an ecr repo without deleting existing one 
Basically if you make ECR repository to your aws account by terraform so terraform make your ecr repository by deleting existing one which is present in you aws acount 
so this code will help you to make ecr repository 
without deleting existing one in your aws accout 
hope this will work for you.
